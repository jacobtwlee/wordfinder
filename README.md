## Word Finder

Word finder is a helper for games like Scrabble and Words With Friends. Given an input string, wordfinder will print all of the words (and their scores) that can be formed by rearranging any subset of the letters in the input.

#### Usage:
```python wordfinder.py``` or ```python wordfinder.py <some letters>```

#### Notes:
Currently wordfinder can be run from the command line, or it can be imported as an external module. The goal of this project is to eventually create a client/server application to simplify ease of use.
